## Introduction

NuSchedule is a straightforward yet sophisticated application that helps you manage your events. It allows you 
 to keep track of not only your school events or activities (eg. lectures, tutorials, assignments), but 
also your personal activities. It utilises a command line interface (CLI), which accepts user input in the form of text. 
This gives the application both simplicity and speed, setting it apart from other apps such as NUSMods and Luminus.

### View available commands

Shows list of commands and provides a link to the user guide for more details. 

Format: `help`


### Add an event

Adds events/tasks to the schedule. Can support various types of tasks: 



* Personal events  
  Format: `personalEvent EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /l LOCATION` for underline event.  
  OR `personalEvent EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /o MEETING_LINK /p MEETING_PASSWORD` for online events.  
  Note that `/e DATE TIME` is optional. You have a personal event without an ending time.  
  In `/e DATE TIME`, `DATE` is optional. If you enter `/e TIME`, the default date will be the same 
  as the date that the event starts.  
  For online events, `/p MEETING_PASSWORD` is optional, since not all online events require a password.

* Assignments  
  Format: `assignment EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /l LOCATION`  
  OR `assignment EVENTNAME /t DATE TIME /o SUBMISSION_LINK`  

* Classes  
  Format: `class CLASSNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /l LOCATION`  
  OR `class CLASSNAME /t DATE TIME /e DATE TIME /o MEETING_LINK /p MEETING_PASSWORD`  
  Same as in personal events, in `/e DATE TIME`, `DATE` is optional. For online events,`/p MEETING_PASSWORD` is optional.  
  However, `/e DATE TIME` or `/e TIME` is required, since any class should end at some time. 


Example of usage: 

`personalEvent Mom’s Birthday /t 2020-10-26 19:00 /l home`  
`class CS2113 Lecture /t 2020-09-23 10:00 /e 12:00 /l LT27`

### Edit an event
The `edit` command allows you to edit the event type, description, start/end date and location for an existing 
event. You can start using this command by entering `edit INDEX`, where INDEX is the number of the task you want to
edit. 

Format: `edit INDEX`  

Example:  

Let's say you have one event stored in NuSchedule currently:  

![edit1](diagrams/edit1.png)
Suppose you entered the timing incorrectly and would like to edit it to the correct timing. Enter the following command
to edit the event:  

![edit2](diagrams/edit2.png) 

Next, you will be prompted to enter the new values for the 5 fields which are type, description, location start and end 
date respectively. Enter your desired changes and press the `ENTER` key to go through the fields. You can leave a field 
blank and simply press enter if you do not want to make any changes.

### Sort events
With this command, you can sort all events by either their end time, location or their description. When sorting by time, events
will be sorted in a chronological order. Events with an earlier end date will be sorted on top of events with later end
dates. This way, you can prioritize the events that are due soon.   

When sorting by description, the events will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their descriptions. Events 
with descriptions starting with 'a' will be sorted on top of events with descriptions starting with 'z' for example.  

When sorting by location, the events will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their location. Events with
offline locations will be sorted on top of locations with online locations.  

Format: `sort SORT_CRITERIA`  

Example: `sort description`

Before sorting:  
![sort1](diagrams/sort1.png)

After sorting:  
![sort2](diagrams/sort2.png)

Sort by time:  
![sort3](diagrams/sort3.png)

Sort by location:  
![sort4](diagrams/sort4.png)

### Find a location
Shows you the location of the specified event/task.  

Format: `locate n/EVENTNAME`  

Example: `locate n/CS2113t Tutorial`

### List all events
Shows you a list of all events.  

Format: `list`  

### Clear events
Deletes all events in the list.  

Format: `clear`  


### Mark event as done
Mark an event that has been completed with `DONE`.  

Format: `done INDEX`  

Example: `done 1`  

### Reminder of deadlines
Shows a list of all events for today's date.

Format: `reminder`


## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.
